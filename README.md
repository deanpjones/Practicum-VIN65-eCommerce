"# Practicum-VIN65-eCommerce" 

This was a study to see if they could push information from the website to their accounting software.

There was a VIN65 website that used a web service that I needed to troubleshoot the HTTP response errors. It turned out that the documentation was incorrect for the request example. Once I resolved this the data was easily queried.

I was in the process of setting up a fixed width file that would be used to upload data to the accounting software for Epicor.
